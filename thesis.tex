\acknowledgments {\indent I have done my best in this dissertation to explain the research I have conducted as a linear progression from a set of mysteries and unanswered questions to questions to a set of conclusions. This style of explanation may be best for the sake of clarity, but it is not a faithful representation of the winding journey of discovery, both scientific and personal, that has characterized the past six years of my life. 

Throughout this journey, I have benefited from the guidance of many amazing scientists. I am truly lucky to have had the opportunity to work closely with Simon Birrer, who always seems to know the right question to ask in order to solve a problem. I am also indebted to Anna Nierenberg, with whom I have collaborated since day one. Anna has a keen an eye for important details others may overlook, and I believe working with her has made me a better scientist. 

It is difficult to convey just how much I admire my PhD advisor, Tommaso Treu. To the astronomy community as a whole, Tommaso is regarded as a productive, creative, and talented scientist. To me, he is a role model, a leader, and the kind of person I want to be. I could not have asked for a better advisor. 

Finally, I am thankful for my amazing parents. It must have been wild listening to me try to choose a career path: from a pilot, to joining the foreign service, and then finally setting down with astrophysics. Through it all, you have supported me, challenged me, and believed in me. As I get older, I realize more and more how lucky I am to have you two as my parents - I could not have done it without you!
